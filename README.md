# React_Vite_Portfolio

## Description
In this project, I used React and Vite to create and deploy my own portfolio page. Vite is an increasinly popular way to deploy front end apps so I thought I would hop on
the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out it's pretty sweet. The old, slow way of using create-react-app is a thing of the past with Vite taking a fraction of the 
time and deploying to a gh-page is super simple as well.
